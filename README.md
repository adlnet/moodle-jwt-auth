## Moodle JWT Auth

Simple auth plugin for handling an inbound JWT header and automatically creating an account for that user.  

**Disclaimer:** This plugin:
- Is in active development.
- Is not safe for general public use.
- Assumes that all traffic to your Moodle instance has already been secured.

There is a straightforward issuer + client check, but that is it.
